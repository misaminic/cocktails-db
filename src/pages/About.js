        Cocktails are a form of art, one of the greatest expressions of human
        creativity applied to the world of spirits, liquors and juices.

      <p>
        The first known guide to cocktail making was published in 1862 by well
        known American bartender Jerry Thomas. Thomas owned and operated saloons
        across New York city in the 1800's and is often considered the father of
        American mixology.

        People have been mixing drinks for centuries, often to make an
        ingredient more palatable or to create medicinal elixirs. It wasn't
        until the 17th and 18th centuries that the precursors of the cocktail
        (e.g., slings, fizzes, toddies, and juleps) became popular enough to be
        recorded in the history books. Though it's unclear where, who, and what
        went into the creation of the original cocktail, it started out as a
        specific drink formula rather than a category of mixed drinks.
